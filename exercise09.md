# Exercise 9 - Viewing history

1. Make a commit with a multi line commit message
   (leaving an empty line after the first line)

2. View that commit in the log

        git log -1

3. View the full commit log

        git log

4. If the log fills your whole terminal, press `q` to exit

5. View a shortened version of the commit log

        git log --oneline

6. Pick a commit hash from the log

7. View the commit log from the chosen commit backward

        git log --oneline <commit_hash>

8. Bonus - How much of the commit hash do you need to specify?

9. Bonus - Can you show just the last three commit messages?
