1. Ensure you have a clean working directory

        git status

2. Edit one of your lists to add a few items

        vim fruits.txt

3. Edit another of your lists to add a few items

        vim equipment/appliances.txt

4. Look at git status

5. Can you commit both of the changed files in a single commit?

6. After you do so, check that you have a clean working directory

7. Edit two more files

        vim vegetables.txt equipment/furniture.txt

8. Can you commit just one of the changed files?

9. Check your status

10. What does red mean in the output of git status?

11. What does green mean in the output of git status?

12. Bonus - Can you make a single file show in both red and green
    in the output of `git status`?
